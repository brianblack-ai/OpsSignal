# OpsSignal
OpsSignal is an operational AV intake and estimation platform that converts inbound demand into structured, actionable signals for sales and operations teams.

Most lead-generation tools stop at capturing contact information. OpsSignal goes further by applying domain-specific estimation logic at the point of intake, producing realistic budget ranges and operational context before a human ever gets involved. The result is fewer junk leads, fewer status meetings, and clearer decision-making across sales and ops.

At its core, OpsSignal is designed for service-based, operations-heavy businesses—like AV production companies—where bad inputs create real downstream cost. Instead of flooding teams with unqualified inquiries, OpsSignal shapes demand into signals that teams can trust.
